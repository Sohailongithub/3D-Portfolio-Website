# 3D Portfolio Website

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio repository! 🌟

This project showcases my journey into the exciting world of 3D web development. I've leveraged a combination of powerful technologies to create a visually stunning and interactive portfolio. Special thanks to [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) for providing valuable insights and guidance throughout this creative process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structural foundation of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Empowering the styling with a utility-first approach.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for dynamic behavior and interactions.
- **React.js**: A powerful framework for building modular components.
- **Three.js**: An incredible library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Framer Motion**: Adding smooth animations to enhance user experience.
- **React Three Fiber**: Making the integration of Three.js seamless within React.

## Key Learnings

In the journey of building this website, I've gained valuable insights into:

- Loading, creating, and customizing stunning 3D models with geometry.
- Understanding the 3D world, including working with cameras and positioning in object space.
- Prioritizing code reusability and scalability through higher-order components and industry best practices.

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices. 📱💻

## Contact Form

I've implemented a contact form in the portfolio using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send and receive emails. Feel free to drop me a message!
